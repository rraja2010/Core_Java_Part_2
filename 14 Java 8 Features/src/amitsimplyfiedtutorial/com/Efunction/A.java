Function
============ 
--	Functions are exactly same as predicates except that functions can return any type of result but 
	function should(can)return only one value and that value can be any type as per our requirement

--	To implement functions oracle people introduced  Function interface in 1.8version. 
--	Function interface present in java.util.function package. 
--	Functional interface contains only one method i.e., apply() 

interface function(T,R) { 
           public R apply(T t); 
}
