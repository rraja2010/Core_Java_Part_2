/*
Declaring the class inside another class is called nested classes. 
This concept is introduced in the 1.1 version.
The nested classes are two types
Static nested classes:- The nested classes declare as a static modifier is called static nested classes.
1. Static nested classes
2. Non static nested classes:- these are called inner classes.

1. Normal inner classes
2. Method local inner classes
3. Anonymous inner classes


For the outer classes-A1 the compiler will provide the .class 
	and for the inner classes also the compiler will provide the .class file.
The .class file name for the inner classes is OuterclassName$innerclasssname.class -A1$B.class and A1$C.class
