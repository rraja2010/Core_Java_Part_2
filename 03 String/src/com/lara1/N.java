 * In Java(tm), "null" is not a keyword, but a special literal of the null type. 
 * 	It can be cast to any reference type, but not to any primitive type such as int or boolean. 
 * 		The null literal doesn't necessarily have value zero. 
 * 			And it is impossible to cast to the null type or declare a variable of this type.
